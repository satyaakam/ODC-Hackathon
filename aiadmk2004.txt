Parliamentary General elections to the 14th Lok Sabha are to the conducted soon. Following elections to the 13th Lok Sabha in 1999, the National Democratic Alliance Government was formed with the DMK, MDMK, PMK and others as constituent parties. But, during the last five years of the NDA Government, Ministers from these parties representing Tamil Nadu failed to lend any support to the development plans to Tamil Nadu or to the State’s social welfare schemes to improve the quality of life of the people of Tamil Nadu. Based on the belief that if such beneficial plan allocations which were obtained from the Centre by the efforts other Chief Minister Puratchi Thalaivi J Jayalalithaa, reached the people, it would only enhance the prestige of Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, these parties were pursuing with vengeance their obstructionist policies. Though the people of Tamil Nadu had voted them to power and made them MPs and Central Ministers with the fond hope that they would work for the development of Tamil Nadu, they were only assiduous in betraying the very people who elected them, to power. Ignoring the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu who had elected the, they were only intent on looking after their own interests for the entire period of 6 years. They threw to the winds the tall poll promises that they had made to the people of Tamil Nadu at the time of the 1999 Lok Sabha Elections.
