The Open Manifesto Process:
Pathbreaking Political Reform

The Indian National Congress has pioneered an entirely new way in which
political party election manifestos are prepared. It is our firm belief that the
Indian National Congress Manifesto must reflect the voice and aspirations of
the people and a new vision for the country.
There were several consultations held across the country over a five-month
period (from October, 2013 to March, 2014) with different stakeholders, to
get their inputs on India’s future growth, development and inclusion agenda.
The Congress Vice President Shri Rahul Gandhi participated in several of
these interactions including those with representatives from Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, minorities, women organisations,
youth, labour, industry, Panchayat representatives, ex-servicemen, railway
porters, rickshaw pullers, salt-pan workers and farmers. In addition to this a
dedicated website (www.incmanifesto.in) was established to invite suggestions
from all citizens for the Manifesto. A separate website for the “National Student
Manifesto” was also created.  
We received tens of thousands of suggestions through these consultations, on
the websites and social media platforms, phones, emails, etc. These suggestions
were carefully considered and have been included, wherever feasible.
We believe this unique exercise has made the Manifesto inclusive and fully
reflective of the voice of the people of India.

•	 An Appeal

The Indian National Congress has made
seminal contributions to India’s unity,
integrity, secular polity and democratic
federalism. We have championed the rights
of the weaker sections, created conditions for
faster economic growth and have been the
principal instrument of social and economic
change, the preferred political choice for
crores of women and men.

modernise the Indian economy and bring
about the information and conmunications
technology revolution.  In the 1990’s, radical
economic reforms were instituted leading to
accelerated economic growth and widespread
economic and social transformation. At the
turn of the millennium, we brought about
a “Regime of Rights” marking a paradigm
shift in India’s politics and development.
Beginning with the Right to Information,
Right to Work (Mahatma Gandhi National
Rural Employment Guarantee Act), Right to
Education and the Right to Food, we have
launched a radical progressive economic and
social development discourse.

Our central values resonate the very idea of
India, that has come to us over the centuries,
an India that rejoices in and celebrates
its many diversities, and builds on these
diversities to strengthen the bonds of unity
through secularism, pluralism, inclusion and
social justice. This is the India that
Mahatma Gandhi envisaged. This
is the India for which our Freedom
Fighters gave their all. This is the
India that the Indian National
Congress has always dedicated
itself to. Ours is the one Party with
a history of a liberal philosophy
that has enabled the country to
build strong political and economic
institutions and transform itself.

communal harmony, and economic growth
and social justice, are two sides of the same
coin and must always go hand-in-hand.

regional balance, progress in backward
areas and a strong conviction that in order
to prosper every citizen must have the
opportunity to evolve to the best of her or
his ability. Ours is a Nation of incredible but
often untapped talent that needs and deserves
to be unleashed.

The Indian National Congress is the only
Party that combines experience and youth,
wisdom and exuberance, achievement and
ambition.

We envision an India where power would
have been devolved to the grassroots and to
the marginalized so that they can shape their
own destiny.

The Indian National Congress seeks a renewed
mandate on the strength of its heritage, its
record of service, both in and out of power,
and its clear vision for the future.

We envision an India charting a new future
rather than rewriting its past; living in
harmony, not in turmoil; thriving in peace

The Onl y Choice

In the 1950’s, the Indian National
Congress put India on the path of
industrialisation through the public sector,
ensuring both rapid and balanced regional
growth across the face of our country.
A massive infrastructure for science and
technology was also established. In the 1960’s,
the Green Revolution was launched to make
India self-sufficient in food grains and a direct
assault on poverty. In the 1970’s, further gains
were made through the Green Revolution and
a White Revolution was unleashed that was
to make India the world’s largest producer of
milk. In the 1980’s, economic reforms were
launched in response to new challenges, to

The depth and breadth of its political and
administrative experience makes the Indian
National Congress most intrinsically aware
and closely associated with the beliefs, and
principles and need of the people of India.
We are the Party that has always believed in
the idealism and leadership abilities of the
youth. We have remained connected with
their aspirations and have been inspired by
their restless vibrancy.
Our vision is one of inclusive and sustainable
growth fuelled by agricultural development,

humility, not with arrogance.
We envision an India where the government
serves the people rather than where people
serve the government.
We believe in a simple universal truth: equity
and opportunity for all.

Party that believes that economic growth and

he Indian National Congress-led UPA
government has had an unmatched record
when it comes to the passage of significant,
historic and pathbreaking legislation. The
Indian National Congress is a Party that takes
its commitments to the people as sacred.
The Party has worked to realise almost all
the promises made to the people in its earlier
Manifestos and campaigns:

from Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act,
2013. These laws made the system more
sensitive to the challenges faced by our
women. Penalties have increased and new
crimes were included to make the definition
more women friendly so that the law better
serves the interests of the aggrieved.
4.	 In a bid to bring greater clarity on
the subject, the Congress-led UPA
Government enacted a new Companies
Act, 2013. This new law, resulting from
comprehensive consultations with all
stakeholders brings about radical changes
that will stimulate entrepreneurship,
make it easier to start new businesses

1.	 The Indian National Congress led
the charge to enact a unique and
unprecedented law to safeguard food
security for the poorest. The National
Food Security Act marked the realisation
of over a decade of work and has been
hailed as a visionary
law by the people.

Act will protect livelihood rights of lakhs
of street vendors.

and Lokayukta Act, 2013 was born out
of a determination to give the people
a strong, independent authority to act
as a watchdog against administrative
corruption. This authority empowers the
people by giving them a high-powered
forum to tackle corruption in the
bureaucracy and the political system.

10.	 The Prohibition of Employment
as Manual Scavengers and their
Rehabilitation Act, 2013 not only
prescribes stringent punishment for
employing manual scavengers but also
has provisions for rehabilitation of these
families. An age-old blot on our society
will finally be erased.

7.	 In one earliest actions on being re-elected,
the Congress-led UPA government
passed the Right of Children to Free and
Compulsory Education Act in 2009. This
law, which guarantees free education
in primary schools, also puts in place

1.	 We will endeavour to bring around twothirds of our population – the skilled hands
that build India – into the middle class,
through a package of basic rights for all
workers – formal and informal, organized
and unorganized, regular and contractual.
Our aim will be to provide them and
all low-income families with economic
security and a minimum standard of living
to uplift their condition. The charter of
minimum socio-economic rights we will
put in place includes:
a.	 Right to Health
b.	 Right to Pension
c.	 Right to Homestead or Housing
d.	 Right to Social Security
e.	 Right to Dignity and
humane working
conditions
f.	 Right to Entrepreneurship that will
protect and assist all
those who seek to
become entrepreneurs

2.	 To support the Right to Health, the
Indian National Congress will increase
health expenditure to 3% of GDP and
provide universal and quality health care
for all Indians (including free medicines).
To support the right to homestead/
housing, we will ensure affordable and
quality housing for all. The Indira Awaas
Yojana and the Rajiv Awaas Yojana will be
expanded to cover all poor rural and urban
households.
3.	 Continuing our record of delivering India’s
highest growth rates, we will restore India
to 8% plus growth rate within 3 years:

India a world leader in agricultural
production and agro-industry, taking
advantage of our national endowments
and the genius of our farmers. We
will focus on increasing agriculture
productivity and farmer incomes by
increasing investments in irrigation,
agricultural value chains, cold storage
and warehousing, etc.
f.	 We will introduce the Goods and
Services Tax Bills and a new Direct
Tax Code Bill in Parliament and ensure
they are enacted within one year.
g.	 We will ensure that the unpredictable
risk of retroactive taxation is avoided.
h.	 We will invest more than 1 trillion

k.	 We will ensure that growth is socially
responsible, and comes from genuine
value addition, not from stripping our
natural resources or from underpaying
our labour.
l.	 We will ensure that all our towns and
Gram Panchayats are connected with
high-speed broadband connectivity
within 18 months.
m.	 Serious and systematic efforts have
been made by the Congress-led UPA
government to track down and recover
black money. This determined effort
will continue unabated. We will appoint
a Special Envoy to pursue this agenda.

1.	A New Future for
the Hands that Build
the Nation
It is because of the Indian National Congress
that employees in the organised sector have
been fully protected through legislation and
are entitled to social security in different
ways. While organised sector employment
must expand, the reality is that employment
in the unorganised sector contributes close to
94% of India’s labour force.

5.	 Strengthening of collective bargaining;
6.	 Programmes for upgrading skills and
income including use of improved
technology.

2.	Economic Growth
The Indian National Congress is committed
to achieving 8 % growth per year, within
3 years, to be sustained over the next two
decades.

In recent years, with the expansion of
employment opportunities because of rapid
economic growth, this segment has expanded.
In recognition of

annum, compared to 5.9 % delivered by the
NDA, even as poverty has declined three times
faster. The growth under the Congress-led
UPA has been faster and more inclusive than
any earlier period in India’s history. And it is
not just the acceleration of growth that gives
the Indian National Congress satisfaction. In
keeping with the long-standing tradition of
the Indian National Congress, we have made
the growth process more socially inclusive
than it has ever been.

ii.	 Current Account Deficit: Our Current
Account Deficit can be financed only by
foreign investment, whether it is Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) or Foreign
Institutional Investors (FII) or External
Commercial Borrowing (ECB) or any
other kind of foreign inflow.   Hence,
there is no room for any aversion to
foreign investment.
iii.	 Price Stability and Growth: In a
developing economy we must accept that
when our aim is high growth there will
be a moderate level of inflation.  Reserve
Bank of India must strike a balance
between
price
stability and growth
while formulating
monetary policy.
iv.  Infrastructure:
We will rebuild
our infrastructure
and add a huge
quantity of new
infrastr ucture.
Every
proven
model must be adopted. The Public
Private Partnership (PPP) model must be
made more transparent and competitive
and more widely used. New financing
structures will be created for long term
funds and pooling of investments.
v.	 Manufacturing: We will focus on
manufacturing and especially on
manufacturing for export.   We propose
that all taxes, Central and State, which
go into an exported product should
be waived or rebated. We also propose
that there should be a minimum tariff
protection so that there is an incentive to
manufacture goods in India rather than
import them into India.

The UPA governments’ record on growth is
unparalleled.

The Detailed Action Plan
2014 -2019

The
Indian
National Congress
believes that it is time to scale up these
programmes across the country so that all
workers derive benefits from both legislation
and programmes in the next five years. To
ensure a basic rights and welfare package
for all working people, the Indian National
Congress will ensure:

The Indian National Congress’s agenda is
one of social and economic transformation.
Growth is essential for this transformation
to happen and for it to be truly meaningful.
It is economic growth that creates jobs for
our youth. It is economic growth that gives
us the resources to invest in our social welfare
programmes and infrastructure development.
The nature and quality of growth is equally
important to ensure that the gains of growth
are equitably distributed.

2.	 Provision of Pension cover;
3.	 Provision of life and disability cover,

and old age homes;

Over the last ten years, the Congress-led UPA
governments have pursued and delivered

have delivered economic growth of 7.5 % per

However, given the economic slowdown
in the last few years, driven by the global
financial crisis, bringing India back on track
to achieve 8% inclusive growth will be an
overriding priority of the next Congress-led
government.

An Economic Roadmap for 2014-2019
The Finance Minister in his budget speech
earlier this year has laid out a roadmap of ten
important tasks to be undertaken by the next
government. The Indian National Congress
affirms its commitment to this roadmap
which is outlined below:

target of fiscal deficit of 3 % of Gross

Sector
Reforms:
The
recommendations of the Financial
Sector Legislative Reforms Commission
that require no change in legislation must
be implemented immediately and, for the
other recommendations, we must draw a
timetable for passing legislation.
vii.	 Subsidies: Given the limited resources,
and the many claims on the resources,
we must choose the subsidies that are
absolutely necessary and give them only
to the absolutely deserving. We will
also consider introducing sensible user
charges because many more people are
willing to pay for better quality services,
for example, uninterrupted power and
better quality
train services.
We will use
this
money
saved
to
expand health,
education and
infrastructure.
viii.	Urbanisation:
Our
cities
will become
ungovernable, and perhaps unlivable, if
we do not address the decay in our cities.
Cities have wealth, cities also create
wealth. That wealth should be tapped for
resources to rebuild the cities with a new
model of governance.
ix.	 Skill Development: Skill development
must rank alongside secondary education,
university education, total sanitation and
universal health care in the priorities of
the government.
x.	 Sharing responsibility between States and
Centre: States have the fiscal space to bear a
reasonable proportion of the financial costs
of implementing flagship programmes and
must willingly do so, so that the Central

government can allocate more resources
for subjects such as defence, railways,
national highways and telecommunications
that are its exclusive responsibility.

The Indian National Congress’s 	
100 Day Agenda for Growth
While the above presents a medium-term
agenda for reform, the immediate priority is

National Fiscal Responsibility Council
that will submit an annual report to
the Parliament on the progress made in
achieving our fiscal commitments.

been weaved into the very fabric of the
Indian National Congress. It is because of the
initiatives of the Indian National Congress
that the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes
and Other Backward Classes have seen

21

an improvement in key socio-economic
indicators. In fact the annual rate of decline
for poverty in the period between 2004–05

the Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation
Act, 2013 to push for rehabilitation of
these families. The Constitution (117th  
Amendment) Bill 2012 to provide reservation
in promotions for Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes has been passed by the Rajya
Sabha. We will continue to fight the deepseated prejudices,
traditional
hierarchies
and
faced
disparities
by these sections,
socially, politically
and economically.

to fund the cost of education in both
private and government institutions for
Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe

committed to creating national consensus
on affirmative action for Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the
private sector.

will be undertaken to fill all the backlog
vacancies in reserved posts in government
and Public Sector Undertakings.

empowerment.

14.	 The Indian National Congress is deeply
committed to developing a National
Action Plan for the Development of
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and
Other Backward
Classes. There shall

domestic violence against women.
12.	 The Indian National Congress, true to its
long-standing history, will take measures
to enable increased participation and
reservation for women at all levels within
the government. We will ensure that at
least 25% of the total police officers, subinspectors and constables at every police
station in the country will be women,
over the next five years. We will ensure
the number of women police stations in
the country goes up from 500 to 2000 in
the next five years.

9.	 We will increase the number of girls
hostels, particularly in tribal areas and
hostels for working women, with day care,

least 30% of all
funds
flowing
into
Panchayats
and Nagarpalikas
for development
of women and
children and focus
on the special
needs of female agricultural labour and
women cultivators.

committed to the enactment of the
Women’s Reservation Bill to reserve
33 % of all seats in the Lok Sabha, and in
all State legislative assemblies for women.
6.	 We will initiate immediate action to
formulate a Citizens Charter for Women’s
Safety and Security.

priority and will be taken up with all State
governments and special Schemes will be
introduced, like through the National
Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) for

distributed to children belonging to the
minority community. The Corpus of the
Maulana Azad Education Foundation has
been more than tripled to over Rs 700 crore

with women’s Self-Help-Groups for the
distribution of free sanitary napkins for
adolescent girls.

8.	Youth and
Student
Agenda

The Indian National

on the implementation of the Rashtriya
Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, to improve
quality of secondary education. We will

Education is the backbone of human
development and is vital to ensuring equal
social, political and economic opportunities
for all citizens. We enacted the Right to
Education Act 2009, which provides for
free and compulsory education for children
between the ages of 6 and 14 years. As a
result, enrolment
of children at the
primary education
stage has now
near
reached
universal
levels.
1.98 lakh primary
schools and 1.1
lakh upper primary
schools have been

partnerships with the private sector in
the delivery of education. New Public
Private Partnership models will be
explored and appropriate regulatory
systems,
accreditation
procedures,
policies and incentives will be developed,
to enable private education providers
to take on the challenge of expanding
and improving secondary education, in
particular.

9.	Rural Development and
Panchayati Raj
The Indian National Congress will continue
to work progressively to ensure the prosperity
of rural India.
In the ten years of UPA-I and UPA-II, the rural
areas of the country have seen unprecedented
economic development and improvement in
quality of life. For the first time in over two
decades, the increase in rural consumption, at
18%, has outpaced urban consumption. Rural
poverty declined at 0.7 percentage points
per year between 1993-94 and 2004-05. It
declined more than three times faster at 2.3

to set up small businesses. We will set
up more branches of the Bharatiya
Mahila Bank and women only branches
of other public sector banks. Our
target is to ensure the formation of
7 crore SHGs by 2019.

10.	Agriculture and Farmer
Welfare

that the farmer gets a much higher value
for her or his produce.

5.	 Small and marginal farmers own more
than half the country’s total cattle and
buffalo. However, only 12% of the total
expenditure on agriculture is on livestock
development. The Indian National
Congress will place a special emphasis on
livestock, fisheries, opening of veterinary
schools and centres, fodder development
through animal husbandry programmes
and
schemes
like

of the India Inclusive Innovation Fund
so that innovative enterprises can
profitably, scalably, and competitively
engage citizens at the bottom of the
economic pyramid. We recognize the
need for grassroots innovation and will
ensure this initiative is well funded.

3.	 The Indian National Congress will
increase the annual expenditure on
science and technology to at least 2 %
of GDP. This has to come from both
government and industry. Steps will be
taken to encourage the corporate sector
to invest in Research and Development.

8.	 We currently import popular branded
hardware in the IT sector. We will give
special tax incentives for setting up
manufacturing for such products in
India.

With the passage of the Right to Information
Act, 2005 the Indian National Congress
empowered the people with the biggest tool
to fight corruption and ensure transparency
of public service delivery systems. The recent
landmark Whistleblowers Protection Act,
2014 is another step in our efforts to create
a society free of corruption. The Indian
National Congress will give the highest priority
to the passage of the following Bills:

18.	Governance Reforms
The Indian National Congress will give the
highest priority to ensuring accessibility and
transparency in governance systems.

implemented in letter and spirit and monitored
at every step.

progressive and sensitive to the needs of
people, particularly the poor and the weaker
sections of society. Many recommendations
have been made from time to time. The
Judiciary has also made suggestions. We will
accord the highest priority to instituting these
reforms.

We will ensure appropriate electoral reforms
to make the political process more transparent
and accountable.
The Indian National Congress has always
demonstrated its steadfast commitment to
electoral reforms. This includes strengthening
the legal and judicial framework for
disqualifying those convicted of specified
crimes, disqualifying persons convicted of
crimes against women and weaker sections
and disqualifying those who subvert the
integrity of the electoral process.

Legal and Judicial Reforms
We will bring in a new wave of far reaching legal
and judicial reforms aimed at transforming
the current legal system.
The Indian National Congress considers an
independent judicial system as a corner stone
of our Constitutional democracy and the

of judges increased by almost 50%. Fast-track
courts have been continued and supported.
There has been significant investment in
improving the infrastructure and the working
conditions of judges. Judicial and legal
education has been substantially expanded.

4.	 We will support all initiatives to make
the higher and lower judiciaries truly
representative of the diversity of our
society, especially with respect to gender,
caste, religion and region. This will be
done in consultation with and with the
guidance of the Chief Justice of India and
his/her companion judges and without
derogation from the independence of
the judiciary.

For the first time in decades, pendency of
cases has begun to come down even as new
filings have been going up. In the 2014-2019
period, the Indian National Congress will
bring in a new wave of far reaching legal and
judicial reforms aimed at transforming the
current legal system.

Reservation Bill to ensure one-third
reservation for women in Parliament and
State legislatures.

In the last ten years, UPA-I and UPA-II have
delivered the largest and fastest expansion
of our legal and judicial system ever in our
history. The government has produced a clear
road map for judicial reform and established a
National Mission for Justice System Delivery
and a National Court Management Systems
Committee housed in the Supreme Court and
operating under its auspices. The funding of
the judicial system, including through funds
made available by the Finance Commission,

committed to the resolute defence of
human rights in India consistent with our
Constitution and with the international
law and covenants.

Reducing Delays
6. 	 The
Indian
National
Congress
government will support all measures
taken by the judiciary to improve court
management so as to ensure quick and
timely disposal of cases. A strategy will be
developed for disposing of long delayed
cases. Due consideration will be given to

19.	Internal Security
The Indian National Congress will continue
to deal firmly with internal security threats.

The Indian National Congress is committed
to rapid modernisation of our defence
forces. India’s security preparedness will be
based on a comprehensive security doctrine
that combines conventional and strategic
measures.

The Indian National Congress has always given
the highest priority to internal security. Over
the last few years, spending has been increased,
intelligence
has
been strengthened
and more personnel
have been recruited
in
police
and
paramilitary forces.
As a result, overall
incidence of crime
has reduced. We
will continue to
pursue our internal security agenda with
determination.

The Indian National Congress remains
committed to building peaceful, stable and
mutually beneficial relations with all major
powers and all our Asian neighbours.

3.	 The Indian National Congress has always
given the highest priority to the welfare of
Ex-Servicemen and their families. One of
the first achievements of the first Indian
National Congress-led UPA government
was the creation of the Department of
Ex-Servicemen’s Welfare. In pursuance
of our continued commitment, the Indian
National Congress led UPA-II has now
fulfilled the long-standing demand of
One Rank-One Pension, a key campaign
promise of the Indian National Congress
in 2009. This will bring tremendous relief
to the families of Ex-Servicemen.

The Detailed Action Plan
2014 -2019
1.	 The continued and rapid modernisation
of our Defence Forces is imperative. The
Indian National Congress shall ensure
that this process of procuring the finest
state-of-the-art equipment is carried out
in an atmosphere of efficiency and full
transparency.

1.	 The Indian National Congress recognises
the fundamental need to give a sense
of security to every Indian. It vows to
mobilize all the resources of the State
to maintain law and order and provide
maximum possible security to all Indians,
against both external and internal threats.

2.	 India has emerged as one of the world’s
largest importers of defence equipment;
it is thus imperative to encourage
indigenous manufacturing in every
way. This will also generate substatial
employment. To this end, we shall
work towards giving a fresh impetus to
upgrading our existing manufacturing
capabilities while creating new avenues
for expanding military capability.  

2.	 We will ensure that our police forces are
fully equipped with the modern weapons
and technology. Deployment of specialist
battalions and recruitment of additional
personnel will also be pursued.


provide a further impetus to programmes
designed for the welfare of their families
and expand opportunities for them in
Nation building and other productive
activities.

4. India has emerged as a critical bridge
between the developed world and the
developing world, along with Brazil,
China and South Africa. At the same time
we have our own unique position that
combines the cumulative heritage of NonAligned-Movement and its advocacy of
freedom for African countries and steady
support for Palestine. We will continue
to support the goodwill nurtured for
decades amongst socialist countries.

5.	 On the strategic front India will maintain
a credible deterrence and second strike
capability.  We shall continue the missile
programme to meet potential threats in
the region.

21.	Foreign Policy
The Indian National Congress is committed
to the articulation and implementation of a
robust and dynamic foreign policy.

47

We will continue to extend all possible
humanitarian and development assistance
to enable the Tamil-speaking people and
other minorities to rebuild their lives in a
dignified manner. We will work with other
countries, to prevail upon Sri Lanka to
ensure a credible, objective, time-bound
inquiry into allegations of human rights
violations and excesses committed by the
Sri Lankan forces during the concluding
phases of the operations against the
LTTE.

5.	 We will work to strengthen the South
Asian
Association
for
Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) framework and
endeavour to meaningfully realise a South
Asian economic community, as economic
engagement is critical to realising the true
potential of this region.
6.	 We expect to proceed with our mutual
efforts with China to work through
established instruments towards a
resolution of differences of perception
about the border and the Line of Actual
Control (LAC), even as our economic
cooperation and multi-lateral cooperation
continue to grow.

9.	 For Afghanistan, we believe the real threat
is not within but from terrorism from
beyond its borders. If the peace process
remains Afghan owned and Afghan
driven, we will work to support it.

The Detailed Action Plan
2014-2019
10.	 Protecting Indians overseas from
exploitation or threats will remain
a paramount concern of the Indian
National Congress.

7.	 On Pakistan we will encourage the new
government’s stated position to improve
relations with India but calibrate the
dialogue consistent with delivery on
accountability for 26/11 as well as
dismantling of the infrastructure of
terrorism on Pakistani soil.

For the Indian National Congress, a Manifesto is more than a catalogue
of promises and pledges to be forgotten after elections are over.
It is an agenda for governance to be followed diligently and meticulously.
It is an agenda for good governance on which progress must be reported
to the people of the country, regularly, in a transparent manner.
It is in this spirit that the Congress-led UPA government has been releasing
a “Report to the People” every year. This will continue.
The 2014 Lok Sabha elections will offer stark choices.
On the one side is the Indian National Congress with its long track record of
achievements and accomplishments, with its vision and values bequeathed to it
by a most remarkable generation of Indians led by Mahatma Gandhi.

An Appeal
On the other side is an ideology of hate, bigotry and prejudice, an ideology that
negates the very idea of India that has been cherished by us for centuries.
On the one side is the Indian National Congress, which celebrates and rejoices
in the multitude of diversities of India.
On the other side is an ideology that seeks to impose uniformity
in the name of unity.

8.	 On Sri Lanka, we will engage with
that country to ensure that the Tamilspeaking people and other minorities
have full equality and equal rights under
the law. We will continue to press the
Government of Sri Lanka to implement
the 13th Amendment and create
autonomous provinces, especially the
provinces of the North and the East.

A vote for the Indian National Congress is a vote for fulfilling the aspirations
of the youth of our nation, for ensuring that women lead a life of dignity.
Economic growth, social harmony, empowerment of weaker sections and
strengthening of democratic institutions have to all go hand-in-hand.
It is only the Indian National Congress that will, by its very character,
ensure that this happens.
